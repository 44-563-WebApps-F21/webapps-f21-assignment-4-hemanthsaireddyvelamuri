<h4>ACT I.  _The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square_.</h4>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
 <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley"> MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_In a hoarse voice_.]</p>  <p>Yes.</p> 

   <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring"> LORD GORING.</h5> <p Class = "stageDirections hover"> [_Takes the letter_, _examines it_, _sighs_, _and burns it
    with the lamp_.]</p>  <p>For so well-dressed a woman, Mrs. Cheveley, you have
    moments of admirable common sense.  I congratulate you.</p>
    
   <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley"> MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5> <p Class = "stageDirections hover"> [_Catches sight of_ LADY CHILTERN’S _letter_, _the cover
    of which is just showing from under the blotting-book_.]</p> <p> Please get me a
    glass of water.</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Certainly.</p>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_Goes to the corner of the room and pours out
    a glass of water_.  _While his back is turned_ MRS. CHEVELEY _steals_
    LADY CHILTERN’S _letter_.  _When_ LORD GORING _returns the glass she
    refuses it with a gesture_.]</P>
    
    <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5>  <p>Thank you.  Will you help me on with my cloak?</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>With pleasure.</p>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_Puts her cloak on_.]</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5>  <p>Thanks.  I am never going to try to harm Robert Chiltern
    again.</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">Fortunately you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley.</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5>  <p>Well, if even I had the chance, I wouldn’t.  On the
    contrary, I am going to render him a great service.</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>I am charmed to hear it.  It is a reformation.</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5>  <p>Yes.  I can’t bear so upright a gentleman, so honourable
    an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so—</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>Well?</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h5>  <p>I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern’s dying speech and
    confession has strayed into my pocket.</p>
    
    <h5 Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h5>  <p>What do you mean?</p>
    
   <h Class ="mrs_Cheveley"> MRS. CHEVELEY.</h>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_With a bitter note of triumph in her voice_.]</p>  <p>I mean
    that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife wrote to
    you to-night.</p>
    
    <h Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h>  <p>Love-letter?</p>
    
    <h Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_Laughing_.]</p>  <p>‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to
    you.  Gertrude.’</p>
    
    <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[LORD GORING _rushes to the bureau and takes up the envelope_, _finds is
    empty_, _and turns round_.]</p>
    
    <h Class ="Lord_Goring">LORD GORING.</h>  <p>You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?  Give me
    back that letter.  I’ll take it from you by force.  You shall not leave
    my room till I have got it.</p>
    
    <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_He rushes towards her_, _but_ MRS. CHEVELEY _at once puts her hand on
    the electric bell that is on the table_. _The bell sounds with shrill
    reverberations_, _and_ PHIPPS _enters_.]</p>
    
    <h Class ="mrs_Cheveley">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h>  <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_After a pause_.]</p>  <p>Lord Goring merely rang that you
    should show me out.  Good-night, Lord Goring!</p>
    
    <p Class = "stageDirections hover">[_Goes out followed by_ PHIPPS.  _Her face is illumined with evil
    triumph_.  _There is joy in her eyes_.  _Youth seems to have come back to
    her_.  _Her last glance is like a swift arrow_.  LORD GORING _bites his
    lip_, _and lights a cigarette_.]</p>
