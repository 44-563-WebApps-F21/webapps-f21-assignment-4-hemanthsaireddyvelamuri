<h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>

<h4>ACT I.  _The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square_.</h4>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In a hoarse voice_.]  Yes.

    LORD GORING.  [_Takes the letter_, _examines it_, _sighs_, _and burns it
    with the lamp_.]  For so well-dressed a woman, Mrs. Cheveley, you have
    moments of admirable common sense.  I congratulate you.
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Catches sight of_ LADY CHILTERN’S _letter_, _the cover
    of which is just showing from under the blotting-book_.]  Please get me a
    glass of water.
    
    LORD GORING.  Certainly.  [_Goes to the corner of the room and pours out
    a glass of water_.  _While his back is turned_ MRS. CHEVELEY _steals_
    LADY CHILTERN’S _letter_.  _When_ LORD GORING _returns the glass she
    refuses it with a gesture_.]
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  Will you help me on with my cloak?
    
    LORD GORING.  With pleasure.  [_Puts her cloak on_.]
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  I am never going to try to harm Robert Chiltern
    again.
    
    LORD GORING.  Fortunately you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley.
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  Well, if even I had the chance, I wouldn’t.  On the
    contrary, I am going to render him a great service.
    
    LORD GORING.  I am charmed to hear it.  It is a reformation.
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I can’t bear so upright a gentleman, so honourable
    an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so—
    
    LORD GORING.  Well?
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern’s dying speech and
    confession has strayed into my pocket.
    
    LORD GORING.  What do you mean?
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a bitter note of triumph in her voice_.]  I mean
    that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife wrote to
    you to-night.
    
    LORD GORING.  Love-letter?
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Laughing_.]  ‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to
    you.  Gertrude.’
    
    [LORD GORING _rushes to the bureau and takes up the envelope_, _finds is
    empty_, _and turns round_.]
    
    LORD GORING.  You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?  Give me
    back that letter.  I’ll take it from you by force.  You shall not leave
    my room till I have got it.
    
    [_He rushes towards her_, _but_ MRS. CHEVELEY _at once puts her hand on
    the electric bell that is on the table_. _The bell sounds with shrill
    reverberations_, _and_ PHIPPS _enters_.]
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  Lord Goring merely rang that you
    should show me out.  Good-night, Lord Goring!
    
    [_Goes out followed by_ PHIPPS.  _Her face is illumined with evil
    triumph_.  _There is joy in her eyes_.  _Youth seems to have come back to
    her_.  _Her last glance is like a swift arrow_.  LORD GORING _bites his
    lip_, _and lights a cigarette_.]
